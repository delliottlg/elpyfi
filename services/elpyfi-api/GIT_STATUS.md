# Git Repository Status

## Current Situation
As of 2025-06-26, the elpyfi-api service is part of the main pm-claude repository.

### Structure:
```
pm-claude/                    # Main repository
├── services/
│   ├── elpyfi-api/          # Currently tracked in pm-claude
│   ├── elpyfi-core/         # Should be separate repo
│   ├── elpyfi-ai/           # Should be separate repo
│   └── elpyfi-dashboard/    # Should be separate repo
```

## Intended Structure
According to PM Claude's design, each service should have its own git repository:
- Services are cloned into the `services/` directory
- Each service maintains its own version control
- PM Claude orchestrates across multiple repos

## Migration Plan
1. Initialize new git repository for elpyfi-api
2. Move current code to new repo
3. Update PM Claude's services config
4. Clone the new repo into services/elpyfi-api

## Why Separate Repos?
- Independent versioning
- Separate CI/CD pipelines
- Clear ownership boundaries
- Easier to manage permissions
- Can be developed independently

## Current Working State
The service is fully functional within the pm-claude repo. Migration to separate repository can happen when convenient without affecting functionality.
